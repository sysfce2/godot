	<brief_description>
		Base class for filters. Use effects that inherit this class instead of using it directly.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A "filter" controls the gain of frequencies, using [member cutoff_hz] as a frequency threshold. Filters can help to give room for each sound, and create interesting effects.
		There are different types of filter that inherit this class:
		Shelf filters: [AudioEffectLowShelfFilter] and [AudioEffectHighShelfFilter]
		Band-pass and notch filters: [AudioEffectBandPassFilter], [AudioEffectBandLimitFilter], and [AudioEffectNotchFilter]
		Low/high-pass filters: [AudioEffectLowPassFilter] and [AudioEffectHighPassFilter]

			Frequency threshold for the filter, in Hz. Value can range from 1 to 20500.

		<member name="db" type="int" setter="set_db" getter="get_db" enum="AudioEffectFilter.FilterDB" default="0">
			Steepness of the cutoff curve in dB per octave (twice the frequency above [member cutoff_hz], or half the frequency below [member cutoff_hz]), also known as the "order" of the filter. Higher orders have a more aggressive cutoff.
		</member>
		<member name="gain" type="float" setter="set_gain" getter="get_gain" default="1.0">
			Gain of the frequencies affected by the filter. This property is only available for [AudioEffectLowShelfFilter] and [AudioEffectHighShelfFilter]. Value can range from 0 to 4.
		</member>
		<member name="resonance" type="float" setter="set_resonance" getter="get_resonance" default="0.5">
			Gain at or directly next to the [member cutoff_hz] frequency threshold. Value can range from 0 to 1.
			Its exact behavior depends on the selected filter type:
			- For shelf filters, it accentuates or masks the order by increasing frequencies right next to the [member cutoff_hz] frequency and decreasing frequencies on the opposite side.
			- For the band-pass and notch filters, it widens or narrows the filter at the [member cutoff_hz] frequency threshold.
			- For low/high-pass filters, it increases or decreases frequencies at the [member cutoff_hz] frequency threshold.
