	<brief_description>
		Adds a phaser audio effect to an audio bus.
		Creates several notch and peak filters that sweep across the spectrum.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A "phaser" effect creates a copy of the original audio that phase-rotates differently across the entire frequency spectrum, with the use of a series of all-pass filter stages (6 in this effect). This copy modulates with a low-frequency oscillator and combines with the original audio, resulting in peaks and troughs that sweep across the spectrum.
		This effect can be used to create a "glassy" or "bubbly" sound.
